EXHIBIT A

Privacy Requirements and Recommendations for Development using the Intel® 
Software Development Kit: What Developers Should Know

Disclaimer: Nothing in this document should be interpreted as legal advice.

Purpose
The purpose of this document is to acquaint the developer ("you") with Intel's privacy philosophy and how privacy 
and security controls can be easily incorporated into your exploration, planning, and development efforts. The 
intention is to briefly define the must have requirements as well as describe recommendations based on Fair 
Information Practices Principles  and offer additional reading resources for more information. This document will 
help prepare you to proactively design your application to protect and respect customers' privacy interests.

You should be aware that compliance with international privacy standards and regulations can be 
complicated and includes legal risks. If the application or business objective does not require processing 
personal information from the user, the best practice is not to process such information.

1. Privacy Requirements 
Intel may require You to stop any distribution of Applications not meeting these requirements. Any user 
complaints related to personal information misuse may be considered as grounds for termination of the Software 
license by Intel.
1.1. Notice to users - If your application collects or uses any personal information, the user must be notified about 
what is being collected/used, why it is being collected/used (purpose) and whether the information will be shared 
with anyone else. 

1.1.1. Implementation Example: Provide brief description of your privacy notice with a link to more 
detailed information. 

1.1.2. Definitions of personal information may vary in different countries. Developers should use a very 
broad interpretation of this term to include any information that is directly or may be associated with a 
person. Examples can include: Images, voice, location, name, address, birthday, gender, logged 
activities, survey responses, etc. 

1.2. Use limitation - Personal information may only be used for the purpose described in the notice. 

1.3. Explicit opt-in for transfer to third parties - If you share any collected personal information with third parties, 
you must obtain the user's permission before the information is transferred. 

1.3.1. Implementation Example: Identify the third party, the information to be shared and the purpose for 
sharing the information before asking for user consent. Consent should not be sought for "blanket" 
approval to share with "any" third parties for "any legal" purpose. 
       
1.3.2. Implementation Example: In a social media context, users may have active control over third 
parties to which they want to share their personal information. In this case, the user should be made 
aware of what the third party can do with such access. (i.e. Can they download the personal information 
and use it in any way they desire, or only view the information online?) 

1.4. Storage and transmission of personal information should be done in a reasonably secure manner. 

1.4.1. Implementation Example: Transmission of personal information should be done with SSL or similar 
security. 

2. Privacy Guidelines 
Privacy should be a key part of the requirements and design of your software product. The requirements should 
be formed to ensure that the software product not only meets these privacy and security guidelines but complies 
with any regulatory requirements in the countries where you make the software product available. In addition, the 
code review process should verify privacy and security standards and policies.

Intel defines privacy as an individual's right to have a private life, to be left alone and to be able to decide when 
their personal information is collected, used or disclosed. Any information that can be used to identify, contact, or 
locate someone is considered personal information (e.g. name, address, telephone number, mobile phone 
number, e-mail address, social security number, government identification number, etc.). In addition, any 
information which is linked to personal information or from which other personal information can easily be derived 
is considered personal information too.


All developers have a role and responsibility in understanding privacy compliance requirements and associated 
risks . Below is a summary that highlights what privacy compliance actions can be taken to mitigate certain 
business, consumer, and legal risks.

Compliance Requirements
*	You should know what 
personal information their application's 
process, why, who has access to it 
and who you share it with 
(subsidiaries, vendors, etc.). 
*	You should handle personal 
information in line with Fair 
Information Practice Principles  
(Notice, Choice, Access, Security, 
Purpose, Data Accuracy, Data 
Minimization, Data Retention, Data 
Transfer, and Redress) 
*	You should protect personal 
information with reasonable security 
controls 
Risks
*	Damage to your reputation, 
brand or business relationships 
*	Legal liability and industry or 
regulatory sanctions 
*	Charges of deceptive business 
practices 
*	Customer distrust 
*	Denial of consent by individuals 
to have their personal information 
used for business purposes 
*	Disruption of international 
business operations 
*	Termination of the application 
distribution agreement by Intel 

Some data elements are considered more sensitive than others (e.g. biometrics, children's personal information, 
etc.) and may require additional compliance efforts with statutory rules and regulations. You should review 
these with your legal counsel.

3. Privacy Concepts in Application Development

When you develop an application that collects or uses, shares, stores, or transmits personal information, you will 
need to comply with international privacy rules and regulations The concepts described below can provide 
specific foundational requirement that should be comprehended within your application development efforts.

3.1. Purpose 
Before any personal information collection, you should clearly define the reason why you need to collect personal 
information prior to obtaining it from an individual. You may not use personal information for any other reason 
than the purpose specified to the individual at the time of collection without their prior consent, including 
secondary uses, like direct marketing purposes. 
 
Recommendations on how to prepare for addressing the Purpose within your application 
*	Document your personal information business requirements. 
*	Document a data flow diagram 
*	A list of the personal information that is collected, stored, shared, and transmitted 
*	The method to protect the personal information 
*	Methods of accessing the personal information 
*	The user interface that can be used to control the data capture, storage, and 
transmission 
*	Document any considered secondary use of the personal information by the developer and third parties 
and subsequent notice requirements 

3.2 Notice, Choice, and Consent 
You should provide a clear explanation (Notice) of your personal information handling practices at the time of 
collection. The notice should be easy to find and easy to read. You should obtain affirmative opt-in consent4 from 
an individual before collecting their personal information if required by law. 

Recommendations on how to develop notice, choice, and consent into your application
*	When installing an application or completing a registration form, configure the default to not collect 
personal information. 
*	Use radio buttons, check boxes, or menu selections to notify the individual of their choices and require 
the individual to select before proceeding. 
*	If an individual elects not to have personal information collected, allow the individual to participate as a 
guest if possible. 
*	Add a convenient location in your menu where individuals can revisit your personal information handling 
practices (e.g. privacy option in help menu, privacy footer in website). 
*	When transferring the personal information to third parties, you need to inform the individual. If an 
individual elects not to have personal information transferred to third parties, you need to honor their 
decision. 
*	Inform the individual for how long you will retain the personal information. Don't retain it for longer than 
required to meet your business objectives (e.g. not beyond the end of a support agreement) or to comply 
with applicable law. 
*	4 Opt-in consent means that individuals must take some sort of affirmative action, indicating their desire to 
participate in a given program or service, like filling out a registration page, or submitting their email 
address to receive a newsletter.

3.3. Access to and Accuracy of Personal Information 
You should provide individuals reasonable access to their personal information so the individual can ensure their 
personal information is accurate, complete and current. 

Recommendations on how to develop access and accuracy into your application
*	Create a secure user profile that requires a unique identifier and password combination to allow the 
individual to maintain their personal information. 
*	Organize all of the individual's personal information into a single menu selection or tab that displays all of 
their personal information for easy reviewing and editing. 
*	When an individual updates sensitive personal information, for example, passwords, or financial personal 
information, send a electronic message to the individual stating their <insert> personal information has 
been updated on <date time> by <e-mail address or unique identifier> 

3.4. Minimization and Retention of Personal Information 
You should collect and/or process only the personal information required for a specific purpose and not retain 
personal information longer than necessary to satisfy the purpose for which it was collected. 
Recommendations on how to develop minimization and retention into your application
*	If the individual's personal information is not needed, don't collect it. Deploy uses of pseudonyms  or 
unique identifiers where possible. 
*	Scrutinize the amount of required data elements. Look for opportunities to make personal information 
collections optional or not all. 
*	All personal information collected should have an expiration date associated with it. Formalize the 
lifecycle of data by developing a Data Retention Policy for all personal information data elements and 
include your practices in the privacy statement. 

3.5. Security and Transfer of Personal Information 
You should take reasonable measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, 
modification, disclosure or loss. Recommendations on how to develop security into your application
*	When collecting personal information on the wire, don't transmit in clear text. Implement encryption 
techniques like https or SSL. 
*	Allow the individual a menu of choice on how their information is disclosed. Allow selections from 
everyone to no one or allow the individual to generate their own customizations. 

4. Security Controls to Preserve Privacy
To ensure individual's privacy is preserved and compliance to appropriate regulatory standards has been met 
certain security controls must be employed. The following are some of the vulnerabilities which lead to privacy 
violations:
*	Injection flaws, 
*	Insecure Direct Object Reference, 
*	Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling, 
*	Broken Authentication and Session Management, and 
*	Failure to Restrict URL access. 

Completing a code review and/or vulnerability scan will help to catch these vulnerabilities. You should develop 
security controls necessary to preserve the individual's personal information and account log-in information.

4.1. Input Validation 
Input validation is the process of verifying the input, to ensure it is in the expected format. This involves checking 
for data length, type, syntax and correct business rules, before displaying or storing data. This mitigation against 
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks is quite prevalent. Recommendations on how to perform input validation
*	There are multiple strategies for input validation, for instance whitelist and blacklist validation. It 
is recommended, to do a combination of both. Utilize a whitelist to constrain input to the known good data 
and validate the format, length, and type. Then test for known malicious input using blacklist validation. 
*	Canonicalization is the process from converting data to its simplest form. Web applications utilize this 
process when converting form URL encoding to IP address. It is essential to be aware of potential 
canonicalization errors. Inputs must be decoded and then canonicalized before being validated. This is 
essential because an application should not decode the same input more than once because it could be 
used to bypass whitelist schemes. 

4.2. Enforce Least Privileges 
Individuals should only have the least amount of access or privileges to an application which allows them to 
complete their necessary objective. Following this recommendation can help to prevent individuals from having 
access to someone else's personal information or any other sensitive information. In addition, this concept can be 
used to limit access of a program or even a process. It is essential to determine the necessary information and 
resources to complete a legitimate task. Having a clear understanding of how data is flowing in the application will 
help to limit privileges. Recommendation on how to enforce least privileges 
 
Always enforce the principal of least privileges for an individual's or process' access to any database or backend 
system. The access should be based on the privileges necessary to complete the business objective.

4.3. Information Leakage 
Information leakage occurs when information about an application's configuration or internal workings are 
exposed. The information which is leaked could be sensitive data or could allow an illegitimate individual to gain 
access to the application. A common example is leaking information via an error message by showing debug 
information. Information leakage can also be more subtle such as revealing state information by the duration it 
takes to process certain operations. 

Recommendations on how to prevent personal information disclosure
*	All developers working on a single application should use a common approach to handle exceptions. 
*	Limit contents of error handling messages. An alternative to would be to create a default sanitized error 
message. 
*	Utilize similar or identical error messages. 
*	An additional mitigation strategy for sensitive transactions could be to implement random wait times for all 
transactions to hide this detail from an attacker. 
*	Different components in an application such as a database and web server will have different error 
messages. It is necessary to verify error messages and attempt to disable or limit detailed error handling. 

4.4. Direct Object Reference 
A direct object reference occurs when a developer displays a file, directory, database record, a key or any other 
type of reference. An attacker can use this information to get access without authorization. For instance, if an 
error message for an online store displays a database file location. An attacker could then download the database 
and gather information about the store's customers. This vulnerability can be detected using vulnerability 
scanning tools or a manual code review process. In addition, it could be avoided by using indirect methods such 
as an index or indirect reference map rather than putting the actual location of the file, directory, or etc. 

Recommended controls to prevent direct object reference include
*	Avoid displaying object references whenever possible. 
*	Object references should be validated using a whitelist or "accept known good" approach, i.e. verify paths 
for all directories. 
*	Confirm the user access the reference object has the necessary privileges and authorization. 

4.5. Authentication and Session Management 
HTTP cookies are often used to prove the individual has authenticated and to manage the session. Developers 
should avoid the usage of custom cookies. Flaws in authentication and session management usually involve 
failure to protect credentials and session tokens. This leads to session hijacking and the ability of illegitimate 
individuals to gain access to the application. This can be prevented my ensuring that login occurs on an encrypted 
page, and all credentials or session tokens are encrypted in transit using SSL. Methods for ensuing secure 
authentication and session management

*	Use SSL to transmit all cookies which are used for authentication or session management, not just for the 
login page. 
*	Leverage session management frameworks with built-in session management instead of building your 
own. 
*	Upon successful authentication or a change in privilege a new session tokens should be generated. 
*	Pages should include a logout which will destroy cookies on the server and client-side. 
*	Application should include a timeout which is appropriate to the data classification. 
*	HTTP cookies should not contain any personal information. 

5. Conclusion
Ensuring privacy of your customers and fellow developers is critical. Everyone has the right to be left alone and 
manage their personal information. As developers it is essential to not only know applicable rules and regulations, 
but to understand how privacy should be incorporated as part of the fundamental design of an application. 
Security can provide controls to support privacy but it is crucial to understand fundamental privacy philosophies.

Appendix: Privacy Compliance - Top 10 List

10. Children: You should not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

9. Transparency (Notice): You are required to provide transparency to individuals about what personal 
information we collect by >100 state, local and international laws.

8. Retention: You should not retain information longer than is necessary to achieve your business objectives or 
to comply with applicable law.

7. Choice: Opt-in gives the individual choice to consent to communication from you.You should consider 
implementing opt-in practices, although you may not always be required by law, to only contact individuals who 
have proactively expressed a desire to be contacted.

6. Spam: You may be subject to the CAN-SPAM Act in many situations and therefore should provide clear 
information in the email regarding the source of commercial emails, and details on how to unsubscribe.

5. Vendors: You must make certain your vendors comply with your privacy policies.

4. Sensitive Data: Many privacy laws classify certain categories of personal information as "sensitive" and greatly 
restrict their collection and processing. Sensitive data elements include ethnicity, race, political opinions, and 
sexual orientation. When dealing with these categories of data, you should contact your legal counsel.

3. International Transfer: The European Union substantially limits the international transfer of personal 
information. Intel has certified to a "safe harbor" to transfer such data to the US. (See: 
www.export.gov/safeharbor/ for more info on international transfer & safe harbor). If you don't certify for safe 
harbor you should obtain explicit consent from individuals prior to transferring their personal information; review 
international transfers with your legal counsel.

2. Security Breach Notification: Over 40 US states have security breach notification requirements, and other 
countries are looking to pass similar laws.

1. Privacy Compliance: Intel may terminate your application distribution agreement if you violate applicable 
privacy legislation, or if end-users complain about your data processing activities.
